# Chaos Kitty

Chaos kitty is a chaos oscillator. Most chaos modules in VCV are for generating CV, but this one is for generating audio. There are three different modes: two different chaos oscillators, and a choice of having a resonant filter on the output.


It’s currently monophonic, although it could easily be poly (I just don’t know why you would want that).
The most “sophisticated” sound is from the “pitched” mode. In that mode all the controls do something. You can get almost pitched sounds. It will track a CV input, and it gets more pitched they higher the resonance is.

Main limitations: it’s really unfinished. Needs a lot of work.
