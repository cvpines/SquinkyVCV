# SFZ Player

## What does the player does
It is a VCV module that can load an SFZ instrument, and convert CV and Gate into the sounds. You can think of is as a sampler like Kontakt (from NI), only more stripped down. And free.

It is fully polyphonic, uses very little CPU, and sounds very good.

In addition to the basic CV and Gate, the player has velocity and pitch modulation inputs. And a fairly unique LFM input that lets you do linear, through zero FM using the samples as the carrier.

## What are SFZ instruments

SFZ Instruments, for the uninitiated, are sample libraries. They are usually free or inexpensive. There are many, many excellent libraries out there for download. Plenty of great sounding pianos, drum kits, orchestral instruments, and on to crazy things.
Because SFZ files are simple text files, and the SFZ format is well documented, it is also easy to make your own SFZ instruments. All you need are some sample files and a text editor/

## Using the player

## Plays a subset of SFZ
The SFZ specification is huge, and really designed for implementing a super high end sampled instrument. For a variety of reasons, this player does not implement the full SFZ specification, but only a subset of it.

The result for the user is that any given SFZ instrument may play perfectly, or may play poorly or not at all. So it’s going to be a matter of trial and error. Often the instrument will play just fine. Sometimes not. Unless you are in incurable tinker, there isn’t much you can do if an instrument doesn’t play correctly in our player. Time to move on and try an alternative.

## Where to find SFZ
The following a popular and work well with SFZ player. All are free
VCSL: a collection of all kinds of sampled instruments.
VSCO-2: a collection of mostly orchestral instruments. From the sample people as VCSL, and some overlap.
